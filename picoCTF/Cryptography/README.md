### Mod26
   We need to decode the cipher with rot13 decoder

```
### Easy1
   We need to solve this with Vigenere Cipher decoder
```
picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}
```
### 13
  Again we need to use the rot13 decoder
```
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
```
### Ceasar
   We need to decode it with Ceasar decoder
```
picoCTF{crossingtherubiconzaqjsscr}
```
### Tapping
  We need to decode it with morse decoder
```
PICOCTF{M0RS3C0D31SFUN3902019519}
